# data-processing-in-R

Welcome to this wonderful tutorial of GitHub. 

This repository will be used for us to learn how to use GitHub in real life, not just in our own heads.

Our simulate data file will be used for us to simulate a dataset for analysis and it will be the only file that we will edit in this repository. We will collaborate through GitHub to learn about ways to simulate data in R and additional details of the data simulation process.
